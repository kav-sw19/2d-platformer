# 2d-platformer
Created a 2D Platformer "Doodle Jump"-like game using Pygame - Sprites and Sound fx from DaFluffyPotato (https://dafluffypotato.com).
Game consists of a randomly geenrated map where user can reach as high as they want - game never ends and was created as a pass-time for users. Developing this taught me about handling sprites, physics, object collision and working with Pygame's sprite manipulation.
