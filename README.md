## About
Game consists of a randomly generated map where user can reach as high as they want - game never ends and was created as a pass-time for users. Developing this taught me about handling sprites, physics, object collision and working with Pygame's sprite manipulation. 

## Credits
Created a 2D Platformer "Doodle Jump"-like game using Pygame - _Sprites and Sound fx from DaFluffyPotato (https://dafluffypotato.com)._
